# Rails test scaffold

This is the starting point for the Pennylane Rails live-coding interview.

Before the interview, please prepare your setup by having:
- a recent working ruby (>= 3.3), `ruby -v` should output the version
- having cloned this repo locally
- having run `bundle install` successfully
- having run `rails db:drop db:create db:migrate db:seed` to create the sqlite database

To check everything is working, run `rails s` and navigate to http://localhost:3000, a table with 50 invoices should be displayed.

In case you're stuck and can't find a solution, please reach out to thierry@pennylane.tech
